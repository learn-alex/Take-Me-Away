Project name: Take Me Away...
Team: Michael Miller, Elana Stroud, Jefferey Sham, Erica Schwartz
-----------------------------------


This project is part of the Johns Hopkins 2015 Spring Hackathon. The project is a virtual reality environment created
for google street view. A user will be able to input two locations, via voice command, and then be directed through google
street view. Furthermore, the street view will be fully integrated with the oculus rift, and, therefore, the user will be 
able to view full 360 degree panoramas as they are taken to their destination. Myo Armband support will also allow the user
to stop and start the street view movement so as to get a better look at some parts.
