-----------------------------------
This project is part of the Johns Hopkins 2015 Spring Hackathon. The project is a virtual reality environment created for google street view. A user will be able to input two locations, via voice command, and then be directed to their destination through google street view. Furthermore, the street view will be fully integrated with the oculus rift, and, therefore, the user will be able to view full 360 degree panoramas as they are taken to their destination. Myo Armband support will also allow further user interaction. The user will be able to stop and start the street view movement so as to get a better look at some parts, as well as zoom in and out of street view and switch to satellite view mode as they please.
